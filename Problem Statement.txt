In this project, I have scrapped the laptop details from flipkart website and inferred various information about Laptops,
like on the website which configuration is majorly present and in that Configuration, pick out top pocket friendly laptop brands with good ratings. 
This will give the idea of what’s the configuration of most laptops displayed on flipkart. 
If the configuration is latest then, the user will have all the options with top affordable brands with his/her budget and the user can choose the desired 
laptop and no need to scroll through all the pages as it takes the laptops from all the pages and shortlists thus saving the time of user and giving information 
about what’s latest. I have analysed laptops for different use cases as well as visualized.



Note: If You Run The Webscraping part, you may need to clean your dataset seperately depending on your dataset structutre after values are fetched from webiste.
Kindly start looking over the Part-1 i.e. 1_Sanket_batch-139_Flipkart_Laptops_Webscraping_Data_Cleaning.ipynb from there Our Data 
cleaning starts and In the Next Part i.e Part-2 (2_Sanket_batch-139_Flipkart_Laptops_EDA.ipynb), The Exploratory data Analysis is done.



Instructions:
	1. Load The Csv files in jupyter first.
	2. Read the Note at top of Part-1 jupyter file i.e. in 1_Sanket_batch-139_Flipkart_Laptops_Webscraping_Data_Cleaning.ipynb
